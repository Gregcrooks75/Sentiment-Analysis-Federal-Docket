Comments on any aspect of the ANPRM must be submitted by January 26, 2022. \nADDRESSES : \nWritten comments: You may submit \ncomments and attachments, identified by Docket No. OSHA–2021–0009, electronically at www.regulations.gov, which is the Federal e-Rulemaking Portal. Follow the online instructions for making electronic submissions. The Federal e-Rulemaking Portal at www.regulations.gov is the only way to \nsubmit comments on this ANPRM. \nInstructions: All submissions must \ninclude the agency’s name and the docket number for this rulemaking (Docket No. OSHA–2021–0009). All comments, including any personal information you provide, are placed in the public docket without change and may be made available online at www.regulations.gov. Therefore, OSHA \ncautions commenters about submitting information they do not want made available to the public or submitting materials that contain personal information (either about themselves or others), such as Social Security Numbers and birthdates. \nDocket: To read or download \ncomments or other material in the docket, go to Docket No. OSHA–2021– 0009 at www.regulations.gov. All \ncomments and submissions are listed in the www.regulations.gov index; \nhowever, some information (e.g., copyrighted material) is not publicly available to read or download through that website. All comments and submissions, including copyrighted material, are available for inspection through the OSHA Docket Office. Documents submitted to the docket by OSHA or stakeholders are assigned document identification numbers (Document ID) for easy identification and retrieval. The full Document ID is the docket number plus a unique four- digit code. OSHA is identifying supporting information in this ANPRM by author name and publication year, when appropriate. This information can be used to search for a supporting document in the docket at http://www.regulations.gov. Contact the OSHA \nDocket Office at 202–693–2350 (TTY number: 877–889–5627) for assistance in locating docket submissions. \nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : \nPress inquiries: Contact Frank \nMeilinger, Director, Office of Communications, U.S. Department of Labor; telephone: (202) 693–1999; email: meilinger.francis2@dol.gov. \nGeneral and technical information: \nContact Andrew Levinson, Directorate of Standards and Guidance, U.S. Department of Labor; telephone: (202) 693–1950. \nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : On \nOctober 27, 2021, OSHA issued an ANPRM to initiate rulemaking to protect indoor and outdoor workers from hazardous heat and to obtain additional information about the extent and nature of hazardous heat in the workplace and the nature and effectiveness of interventions and controls used to prevent heat-related injury and illness. \nThe public comment period for the \nANPRM was to close on December 27, 2021, 60 days after publication of the ANPRM. However, OSHA received requests from stakeholders to extend the comment period by an additional 30 days (Document ID 0145) or 60 days (Document ID 0101, 0133, 0141, 0143, 0144, 0148, 0152, 0159). These stakeholders explained that they need additional time to carefully review the questions in the ANPRM, obtain input from members, and provide comments (see, e.g., Document ID 0101). \nOSHA agrees to an extension of the \npublic comment period and believes a 30-day extension is sufficient and appropriate in order to balance the agency’s need for timely input to inform how the agency will proceed with the rulemaking with these stakeholder requests. Therefore, OSHA is extending the public comment period until January 26, 2022. Authority and Signature \nDouglas L. Parker, Assistant Secretary \nof Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20210, authorized the preparation of this document pursuant to the following authorities: Sections 4, 6, and 8 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 653, 655, 657); Secretary of Labor’s Order 8–2020 (85 FR 58393 (Sept. 18, 2020)); 29 CFR part 1911; and 5 U.S.C. 553. \nSigned at Washington, DC, on November \n24, 2021. \nDouglas L. Parker, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational \nSafety and Health. \n[FR Doc. 2021–26269 Filed 12–2–21; 8:45 am] \nBILLING CODE 4510–26–P \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND \nHUMAN SERVICES \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices \n42 CFR Chapter IV \n[CMS–3409–NC] \nRIN 0938–AU55 \nRequest for Information; Health and \nSafety Requirements for Transplant Programs, Organ Procurement Organizations, and End-Stage Renal Disease Facilities \nAGENCY : Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services (CMS), HHS. \nACTION : Request for information. \nSUMMARY : This request for information \nsolicits public comments on potential changes to the requirements that transplant programs, organ procurement organizations, and end-stage renal disease facilities must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
